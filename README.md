# NeatoBotLib

This is an unofficial API client which can help you to interact with the Neato cloudservices which are used to control you Neato Connected vacuum robot.

Thanks to [Lars Brillert @kangguru](https://github.com/kangguru) who reverse engineered the Neato API from which this library is ported from. Port is based on https://github.com/kangguru/botvac

## Usage
Check the examples to get a hint on how to use the library, most is self explanatory.

Currently the following methods are available in the NeatoBotLib class

* Auth
* GetDashboard
* GetRobotState

The method names should give you an idea what the specific action will cause. Still this is not all, but that's what is available for the moment.
